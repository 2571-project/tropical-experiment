## Problem

Applying an automorphism `a` to a polynomial `p` is composing `p o a`. Because of that we have that applying the inverse automorphism to a point and then applying that to `a(p)` gives the original evaluation of `p`: `a(p)(a^(-1)(s)) = p(s)`, which is obvious when you consider `a(p) = (p o a)` and `(p o a)(a^(-1)(s)) = (p o a o a^(-1))(s) = p(s)`

I am mostly interested in combinatorial problems where we want to consider multivariate polynomials with variables having degree at most 1 (that is, multidegrees are tuples over `{0, 1}`), which can be formulated as the quotient space of the polynomial ring over the ideal generated by the variables squared `T[x, y]/<x^2, y^2>` (but for any amount of variables) or more simply: polynomials mod variables square.

The problem then becomes that if I multiply two polynomials under an automorphism `a(pq)` then the trick to get their evaluation doesn't work anymore, because the evaluation only works for certain representatives of the congruence class modulo the ideal, namely the polynomial expressions which don't have terms squared.
